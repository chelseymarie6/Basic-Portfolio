			<h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>

			<p>Hello there! My name is Chelsey Dolan, and I am a student web developer at UCSD Extension. The program is rigorous and fast-paced, covering both the theory and real-world application of full stack web development. Throughout the program I will be building and deploying all types of projects including (but not limited to): front-end websites using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, a browser-based role playing game, a front-end application to solve a real-world problem, a full stack web application with a robust front-end/back-end and scalable database, and several other projects using the latest web technologies.</p>

			<p>I currently work as a grant writer/researcher with a small company. I am responsible for the development and writing for various state and federal grant funding opportunities, and client relationships with cities in Orange County, Los Angeles County, and throughout Southern California.</p>

			<p>When I am not busy studying to become a web developer, I enjoy exploring all my current home of San Diego has the offer including the wonderful beaches, the great hikes and of course, all the trendy restaurants in the area.</p>
